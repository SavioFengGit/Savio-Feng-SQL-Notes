## Introduction of SQL
SQL is a domain-specific programming language that has been used since 1970. It is still widely used in analytics, data engineering and data science to manage data stored in a relational database management system and can be vital when working with structured data.

According to Webopedia, “a programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.” Based on this definition, SQL is a programming language.

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and allows you to access and manipulate databases. SQL can perform queries, retrieve, insert, update, delete and create data in a database. SQL can also create new databases, new tables, stored procedures, views and set permissions on data.

SQL is based on the relational model of Edgar F. Codd and consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL) and a data manipulation language (DML).

SQL is a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) since 1987. However, there are different versions of the SQL language and almost no implementation adheres completely to the standard. Therefore, SQL code often requires some modifications before being transferred between different database systems.
